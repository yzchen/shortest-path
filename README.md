## Introduction :

This is the group project for algorithm in 2017 fall.

Our topic is shortest path in nonnegative weighted directed graph.

Algorithms used here are [dijkstra algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dijkstra%27s_algorithm) and [spfa algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shortest_Path_Faster_Algorithm).
