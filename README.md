Introduction :

This is the group project for algorithm in 2017 fall.

Our topic is shortest path in nonnegative weighted directed graph, algorithms used are [dijkstra algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dijkstra%27s_algorithm) and [spfa algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shortest_Path_Faster_Algorithm).

Usage :

- build

    `make`

- clean previous build

    `make clean`

- run test

    - run dijkstra algorithm

    `./bin/shortest_path dijkstra`

    - run spfa algorithm

    `./bin/shortest_path spfa`
